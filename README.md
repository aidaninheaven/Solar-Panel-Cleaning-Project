# Solar Panel Debris Removal System  
### (Ice & Snow Remover for Energy Efficiency)

##  Project Overview
This project focuses on improving solar panel efficiency by **automatically detecting and removing debris**, specifically **ice and snow**, which can obstruct sunlight and reduce energy output.  
By combining **sensor-based detection** with **active removal methods**, the system ensures panels remain clean, efficient, and operational in harsh weather conditions.
